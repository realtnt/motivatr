# Motivatr

The inspiration for the project came from the aspirations of many people to learn guitar but not following through. We wanted to create a platform that could be used as a reminder and motivation as well as offering some guidance and daily challenges to keep users engaged with the act of playing guitar. We aimed to create a platform that utilized the Kaizen approach:

> Kaizen is **an approach to creating continuous improvement based on the idea that small, ongoing positive changes can reap significant improvements**.
